Holla guys.
So I decided to create a color picker game to help front-end developers better recognise color codes.
I've created the basic html, css and javascript file.
There is a game bug I noticed, when you select a difficulty level and choose new game, the game is not working well (javascript ish).
Also a better user Interface can be built and just incase we can have another level that won't just use RGB but gradient colors using RGBA.
