        <h2>About The Game</h2>
         <p>All colours you can think of in the world can be made by combining Red, Blue and Green in different proportions ranging from 0 to 255, this is the colouring system the computer recognizes</p>
       <p>The RGB Colour Game was built majorly for Front-End Developers to help practise and test thier skills on the RGB colour system.</p>
    <p>Each time you load up the page, you'll see 6 random colours, one of these colours corresponds to the RGB value above, your job is to pick which one that does.</p>
        <p>Remember that there are 3 channels; Red, Blue and Green ranging from 0 to 255 and all that you need are those three colors (RGB) to make every single colour that you want.</p>
